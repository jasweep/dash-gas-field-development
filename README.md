# dash-gas-field-development
A Dash app for gas field development analysis


To Do:

1. Add operational phases and include mob/demob into each phases

2. Add full lifecycle costs in preparation for DCF analysis (e.g. rehabilitation [per well rather than pad], compression station costs, etc...)

3. Add DCF analysis (with discount rate built from 'no risk return', 'country risk', 'industry risk', 'project risk', 'instrument risk?') to calculate NPV and present on separate graph?

4. Add summary statistics such as NPV, max capital exposure etc...

5. Add segmented decline curve for more accurate prediction

6. Refactor code using Numba to attempt for real-time results

7. Try to break it!

8. Upload to Heroku and disseminate as V1.0

* Extra: Consider additional economic factors and adding noise/random factors to parameters. If fast enough, allow for bulk simulation to create predictive results (confidence intervals etc...)
